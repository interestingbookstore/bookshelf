	<h3>Things I don't use, but that you might be interested in</h3>
	<div><a href='https://modrinth.com/mod/presence-footsteps' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Presence Footsteps</a> Adds a bunch of small footstep sound effects based on what block you're stepping on. My opinion: It's really cool, but I personally feel like it can get a bit annoying, not much at all, and it's a really cool mod, but eh. It also has an impact on performance for me. Not a large one at all, but, eh.</div>
	<div><a href='https://modrinth.com/mod/fallingleaves' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Falling Leaves</a> Adds a small particle effect to leaf blocks, giving the perception of leaves dropping off. My opinion: It's neat, but, like the previous mod, feels a tad annoying. Not much, but eh.</div>
	<div><a href='https://modrinth.com/mod/blur-fabric' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Blur</a> When you open a container, be it your inventory or a hopper, you'll get a nice blur effect behind the GUI, which is customizable. My opinion: It's neat, again, but it get's a bit annoying in my opinion.</div>
	<div><a href='https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/effective' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Effective</a> Made by the youtuber doctor4t, who has two videos (<a href='https://youtu.be/gx4mNQHiOUc'>Splashes</a>, <a href='https://youtu.be/AnwoxryEn2g'>Cascades</a>) in which he introduced them. My opinion: The splash effects are cool, but the cascades are pretty loud, and their particles are a bit annoying in my opinion. Why can't I um, just have a setting that turns them off?</div>
