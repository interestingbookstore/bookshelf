	<div class='main-page-description'>
		Mods are cool. Only issue is, other people need to have them as well. Or do they? Client-side mods can enchance
		your experience by providing various performance and small quality-of-life improvements, all whilst not
		introducing any non-vanilla mechanics. I've spent quite a bit of time searching through CurseForge and
		modrinth, and found a list of mods that I use (or have considered), which are listed here.

	<h1><a href='enchantments_page.html'>List of Item Enchantments</a></h1>
	<div class='main-page-description'>
		Ever wanted to make the best tool/armor piece ever (atleast when it comes to enchantments), only to be unsure of what <i>every</i> possible enchantment is? Every wished that someone compiled an <i>accurate</i> (looking at you, DigMinecraft) list of every enchantment possible for every item, so that you don't have to go scrolling through the creative-mode inventory? Well, so did I, so I went ahead and made that list. With the slight caviet that I didn't include Smite and Bane of Arthropods, because who ever uses those?
